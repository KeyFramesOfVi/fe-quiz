# Fire Emblem Heroes Quiz App

A basic Fire Emblem Quiz App following the instructions given by the Javascript online course below:
http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/

Bootstrap has been used as a template for the site as of this version.

The goal of the Quiz App is to show VanillaJS and JQuery proficiency, although it mainly shows the latter through DOM manipulation.

Tasks that I completed for this small quiz include:


* Creating a registration and login page using JavaScript.
* Creating a CookieUtil js file that allows me to store the user's name in a cookie.
* Using localstorage in order to remember the user's answers for each question, as well as the user's name and password once they register.
* Using JSON to store the questions, and using AJAX in order to read the JSON file.
* USing JQUery in order to update the page whenever the user answers a question through the JSON data.
* Using Events in order to traverse to a previous or the next question whenever the user hits the back and next button, respectively.

Each component is labeled so that you can look at the code if you are interested.
index.html's styling are in css/index.css
register.html and login.html's styling are in css/signup.css, and their javascript are in js/register.js and js/login.js, respectively.
quiz.html's styling and javascript are in css/quiz.css and js/quiz.js, respectively.

Further optimizations can be made (such as making the CSS less repetitive, removing some unnecessary Bootstrap files and organizing the 
HTML more), but since the purpose was to practice Javascript, I will probably make those optimizations later. 

If you wish to look at the site and interact with it, I am hosting it through GitHub pages at:
